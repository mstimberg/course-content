    "Well, we seem to have found a very good estimate for action 0, but most of the others are not great. In fact, we can see the effect of the local maxima trap at work -- the greedy part of our algorithm locked onto action 0, which is actually the 2nd best choice to action 6. Since these are the means of Gaussian random variables, we can see that the overlap between the two would be quite high, so even if we did explore action 6, we may draw a sample that is still lower than our estimate for action 0.\n",

    "In this tutorial you implemented both the epsilon-greedy decision algorithm and a learning rule for solving a multi-armed bandit scenario. You saw how balancing exploitation and exploration in action selection is critical in finding optimal solutions. You also saw how choosing an appropriate learning rate determines how well an agent can generalize the information they receive from rewards.\n"
